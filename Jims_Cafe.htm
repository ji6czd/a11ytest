<div class="content">
<p>Jim's Cafe was founded in 1946 by Jim Smith. At that time, Jim was a sergeant in the United States Army, who had just finished a tour of duty in Europe. Ready to begin civilian life, he settled down in the sleepy town of Innisport with his wife, Charlotte, and their son, James Jr.</p>

<p>Taking a second mortgage out on his home, he purchased a run-down book shop in downtown Innisport and set about realizing his dream of owning a successful restaurant. The first few years were lean, but as the town of Innisport grew and prospered, Jim's Cafe became a favorite place for lunch breaks and Saturday night dinners.</p>

<p>For over 60 years, Jim's Cafe has been renowned for excellent service, a dazzling variety of dishes and appetizers, and scenic location. Use the links below to read more:</p>

<a name="reputation"><h2>Reputation for Quality Service</h2></a>
<p>Jim's Cafe was an immediate success. The little cafe quickly garnered a reputation
  for friendly service and delicious food. Jim worked in the kitchen, while his
  wife and sister-in-law took care of the customers. Early on, the two sisters
  created a code which they decided to use to ensure that their reputation stayed
  strong. That code, which is still honored by the staff of Jim's Cafe today,
  reads as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Always have a friendly smile and a kind word to say.</li>
	<li>Service doesn't end when the food is served.</li>
	<li>If it isn't done just right, send it back!</li>
</ul>
